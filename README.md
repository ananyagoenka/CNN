# CNN
Explored convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in the context of image classification.
The following are the steps used:
1. Build and train a baseline model
2. Implement data augmentation techniques
3. Build your own model to improve upon the baseline
4. Generate adversarial examples to explore potential shortcomings of CNNs
